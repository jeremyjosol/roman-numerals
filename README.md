## About
This application is a Roman numeral converter designed to convert integers within a specific range (1-3999) into Roman numeral representations. It's an exercise for practicing functional programming concepts like recursion and closures while utilziing TDD.

## Technologies Used

* _Github_
* _VSCode_
* _Javascript_
* _Node.js v16.13.1_
* _npm v8.1.2_

### Prerequisuites
> _Your computer or codespace should use **Node.js version 16** or greater. For more information, see_ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

## Application Setup

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/jeremyjosol/roman-numerals) by either copying the link or entering the command in your terminal:
    ```
     $ git clone https://github.com/jeremyjosol/roman-numerals
    ```
2. After successfully cloning down the repository, navigate to the **'roman-numerals'** directory, if the file is located in your desktop, enter the following command:
      ```
       cd roman-numerals
3. Before you can use or deploy the project, make sure to install its dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

    `$ npm install`

    > _This command will read the **package.json** file and install all the required packages_.

7. Once its dependencies are installed, you're ready to perform these available options:
    
    - To build the project:
    
      `$ npm run build`

      > _This will compile and prepare the project for deployment._

    - To lint files:

      `$ npm run lint`

      > _This will analyze your code and highlight any potential issues based on your linting rules_.

    - To run tests using Jest: 
    
      `$ npm run test`

      > _This will activate any test suites you've configured in your project and provide feedback on whether they have executed successfully._
        
    - To start the local development server: 
    
      `$ npm run start` 

      > _This will launch a local server for testing and development purposes_.

You should now be set up to use, develop, and test **Roman Numerals**. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out or refer to the project's documentation.
